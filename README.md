# pet_python
For the longest time I have had a standing tradition of downloading the latest Python IDE that I am using onto any new computer of mine and then I begin a file named "daves_pet_python.py" and this is where I just randomly experiment with some python coding for the simple thrill of it. Yes, my pet is a piece of software and your point?
